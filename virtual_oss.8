.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm virtual_oss
.Nd daemon to multiplex and demultiplex an OSS device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an audio mixing application that multiplexes and demultiplexes a
single OSS device into multiple customizable OSS compatible devices
using character devices from userspace. These devices can be used to
record played back audio and mix the individual channels in multiple
ways.
.Pp
.Nm
requires the
.Xr cuse 3
kernel module.
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Pp
       cuse_load="YES"
.Pp
All channel numbers start at zero.
Left channel is zero and right channel is one.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Run program in background.
.It Fl S
Enable automatic DSP rate resampling.
.It Fl Q Ar quality
Set resampling quality: 0=best, 1=medium and 2=fastest (default).
.It Fl b Ar bits
Set sample-depth in bits for the subsequent commands.
.It Fl r Ar rate
Set default sample-rate for the subsequent commands.
.It Fl s Ar size
Set default buffer size.
Size is specified as <samples> or <milliseconds>ms.
.It Fl i Ar priority
Set real-time priority.
.It Fl a Ar amp
Set default DSP device amplification as power of two value.
.It Fl p Ar polarity
Set default polarity of DSP device.
.It Fl e Ar mute
Set default mute state of DSP device.
.It Fl m Ar channels
Set default channel mapping of DSP device.
.It Fl C Ar num
Set maximum number of mix channels.
.It Fl c Ar num
Set mix channels for the subsequent commands.
.It Fl M Ar filter
Add a monitoring filter.
.It Fl t Ar devname
Set control device name.
.It Fl P Ar devname
Set playback DSP device only.
Specifying /dev/null is magic and means no playback device.
.It Fl O Ar devname
Set playback DSP device only which acts as a master device.
This option is used in conjunction with -R /dev/null .
.It Fl R Ar devname
Set recording DSP device only.
Specifying /dev/null is magic and means no recording device.
.It Fl f Ar devname
Set both playback and recording DSP device
.It Fl T Ar devname
Install entry in /dev/sndstat.
.It Fl w Ar name
Create a WAV file format compatible companion device by given name.
This option should be specified before the -d and -l options.
.It Fl d Ar name
Create an OSS device by given name.
.It Fl l Ar name
Create a loopback OSS device by given name.
.It Fl L Ar name
Create a loopback OSS device which acts as a master device.
This option is used in conjunction with -f /dev/null .
.It Fl F Ar size
Set receive filter size in number of samples or <milliseconds>ms for the next device to be created.
.It Fl G Ar size
Set transmit filter size in number of samples or <milliseconds>ms for the next device to be created.
.It Fl D Ar file
Write process ID of virtual_oss to file.
.It Fl g Ar knee,attack,decay
Enable device compressor in receive direction.
See description of -x option.
.It Fl x Ar knee,attack,decay
Enable output compressor and set knee, attack and decay.
Knee is in the range 0..255, while attack and decay are between 0 and 62.
Samples having an absolute value lower than the knee are transmitted
unchanged.
Sample values over the knee are lowered "a little bit".
You can think about attack and decay as a measure of how fast or slow the
gain of the compressor will work.
It is advised that attack is low, so it reacts fast once too high
sample values appear.
It is also advised that the decay value is higher than the attack value so
that the gain reduction is gradually removed.
The reasoning behind this is that the compressor should react almost
immediately when high volume signals arrive to protect the hardware,
but it slowly changes gain when there are no loud signals to avoid
distorting the signal.
The default values are 85,3,20 .
.It Fl E Ar enable_recording
If the value passed is non-zero, recording is enabled.
Else recording is disabled.
This can be used to synchronize multiple recording streams.
.It Fl h
Show usage and all available options.
